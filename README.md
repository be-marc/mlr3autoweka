# mlr3autoweka

*mlr3autoweka* is the package for automatic machine learning with the [Auto-WEKA](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/beta/Projects/autoweka/) system in the mlr3 ecosystem.
The Auto-WEKA project is not updated anymore, and mlr3autoweka is there to benchmark against the old system and not to be used actively in new research projects.
